Codemm frontend (Next.js) for the deterministic SpecBuilder + Activity UI.

## Getting Started

- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` (defaults to `http://localhost:4000`).
- Pick a **Learning Mode** (Practice or Guided/Coming Soon) on the create-activity page; it’s sent to the backend when the session is created.
- Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.
