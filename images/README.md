# Images (Documentation Screenshots)

This folder contains screenshots used by this repo’s documentation (e.g., `README.md` and files under `docs/`).

Guidelines:

- Prefer stable filenames (so links in docs don’t break).
- Use reasonably compressed PNGs.
- These assets are for documentation only (not runtime Next.js assets).
